This is a combination of some plugins I've written. Enable each on the settings page.

## Installing
To install without compiling from source, download the [.midiMixerPlugin from the latest release](https://github.com/Jaggernaut555/midi-mixer-combined/releases) and double click the file.

## Extra
Also included in the midi mixer plugin is an autohotkey script that can be used to restart midi mixer. After installing the plugin click the `Folder` button under activate/deactivate on the plugin page to find the script.
