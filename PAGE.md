This is a combination of some plugins I've written. Enable each on the settings page.

Also included in is an AutoHotkey script that can be used to restart midi mixer. Click on the `Folder` button under activate/deactivate on the top right of this page to find the script. If you have AutoHotkey installed you can set a `Button` to `Run file...` and select that script.
